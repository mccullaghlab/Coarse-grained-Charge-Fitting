# Code to perform coarse-grained charge-fitting


This code repository contains two versions of the coarse-grained charge fitting code.  These are:

## analytic_position_minimzation 
This code performs the analytic coarse-grained charge-fitting and site position minimization using analytic derivatives and gradient descent minimization.  

## grid_anlytic_charge_fit 
This code performs three versions of coarse-grained charge-fitting.  Namely grid, grid with Lagrange multiplier to maintain charge conservation and the analytic charge optimization.  This code does not perform CG site position minimization.
